### Tools used: Excel and Power BI 
### Problem Statement 
Regal Retail, a global retail giant with worldwide store presence, is facing challenges in optimizing its operations and maximizing profitability across diverse geographical markets. The company lacks comprehensive insights into customer behaviours, sales patterns, and operational inefficiencies that are critical for strategic decision-making. 
### Business Relevant Questions:
-  What should the company focus its regional expansion efforts? 
-  Which product categories deserve additional investment? 
-  How can shipping inefficiencies be improved? 
-  What customer segments should the marketing team target? 
-  How can seasonal fluctuations be better managed? 
-  Which underperforming regions need attention? 
-  How can logistics costs be optimized?
-  Which shipping methods provide best value? 
### Process
- 	Verify data for any data entry errors such as missing values, anomalies, duplicates, and data incorrection. 
- 	Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format, and values used. 
- 	Created charts according to the questions asked. 
- 	Finalize and merge all charts into reports and apply slicer to make dynamic. 
### Data Cleaning and Preparation 
In the cleaning process, I conducted these actions: 
-  Since there are a huge number of records that are not filled with “Postal Codes”, instead of removing the attribute, I filled in “Others” for those missing records. 
-  Standardized formats (e.g., currency) 
-  Removing duplicates. 
-  Data validation and correction (e.g., for any shipping costs and order quantity that are less than 0, those data are removed).
### Key Insights 
a) Regional Sales Analysis 
- 	Market Performance: APAC leads in total sales contribution (approximately 3.59M) followed by EU (2.94M) and US (2.30M). 
- 	Customer Segmentation: Consumer segment dominates sales across all regions, particularly in APAC and EU. 
- 	Regional Profitability: EU’s Central region shows the highest average sales per customer (2,114.35) with 777 customers. 
- 	Geographical Distribution: Sales are heavily concentrated in North America, Europe, and Asia, with minimal presence in Africa and Canada. 
- 	Customer Base: The company has served more than 1500 customers in a period of 4 years, generating more than 22K orders worth 11.73M in total sales. 
- 	Seasonal Trends: Sales and profits show strong seasonality with peaks in a period from September to December. 
- 	City Performance: New York City, Los Angeles, and Seattle are top performing cities, while Lahore, Philadelphia, and Tegucigalpa show losses. 
- 	Product Analysis: Chairs, and Bookcases are the highest-selling furniture categories with strong average prices. 
b) Logistics Performance
-  Shipping Efficiency: Average shipping duration is 3.98 days across 22.53K shipments at an average cost of 27.19. Even though there are clear rankings between various regions about shipping wait, the gap has not shown a huge difference (3-4 days in average), showing that the business has managed efficiently in shipping operation. 
-	Shipping Preferences: Standard Class is overwhelmingly preferred (27.64K shipments) over Second Class (9.24K) and First Class (6.75K).
-	 Shipping Duration Distribution: Most shipments (13K) take around 4-5 days, showing opportunity for efficiency improvements. 
-	Order-Shipping Correlation: Higher order volumes in November-December correspond with shorter average shipping durations, suggesting operational efficiency during peak seasons.
