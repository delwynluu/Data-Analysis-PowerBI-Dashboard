### Tools used: Excel and Power BI 
### Problem Statement 
Regal Retail, a global retail giant with worldwide store presence, is facing challenges in optimizing its operations and maximizing profitability across diverse geographical markets. The company lacks comprehensive insights into customer behaviours, sales patterns, and operational inefficiencies that are critical for strategic decision-making. 
### Business Relevant Questions:
-  What should the company focus its regional expansion efforts? 
-  Which product categories deserve additional investment? 
-  How can shipping inefficiencies be improved? 
-  What customer segments should the marketing team target? 
-  How can seasonal fluctuations be better managed? 
•	Which underperforming regions need attention? 
•	How can logistics costs be optimized?
•	Which shipping methods provide best value? 
### Process
•	Verify data for any data entry errors such as missing values, anomalies, duplicates, and data incorrection. 
•	Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format, and values used. 
•	Created charts according to the questions asked. 
•	Finalize and merge all charts into reports and apply slicer to make dynamic. 
### Data Cleaning and Preparation 
In the cleaning process, I conducted these actions: 
+ Since there are a huge number of records that are not filled with “Postal Codes”, instead of removing the attribute, I filled in “Others” for those missing records. 
+ Standardized formats (e.g., currency) 
+ Removing duplicates. 
+ Data validation and correction (e.g., for any shipping costs and order quantity that are less than 0, those data are removed).
