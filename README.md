### Tools used: Excel and Power BI 
### Problem Statement 
Regal Retail, a global retail giant with worldwide store presence, is facing challenges in optimizing its operations and maximizing profitability across diverse geographical markets. The company lacks comprehensive insights into customer behaviours, sales patterns, and operational inefficiencies that are critical for strategic decision-making. 
### Business Relevant Questions:
-  What should the company focus its regional expansion efforts? 
-  Which product categories deserve additional investment? 
-  How can shipping inefficiencies be improved? 
-  What customer segments should the marketing team target? 
-  How can seasonal fluctuations be better managed? 
-  Which underperforming regions need attention? 
-  How can logistics costs be optimized?
-  Which shipping methods provide best value? 
### Process
- 	Verify data for any data entry errors such as missing values, anomalies, duplicates, and data incorrection. 
- 	Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format, and values used. 
- 	Created charts according to the questions asked. 
- 	Finalize and merge all charts into reports and apply slicer to make dynamic. 
### Data Cleaning and Preparation 
In the cleaning process, I conducted these actions: 
-  Since there are a huge number of records that are not filled with “Postal Codes”, instead of removing the attribute, I filled in “Others” for those missing records. 
-  Standardized formats (e.g., currency) 
-  Removing duplicates. 
-  Data validation and correction (e.g., for any shipping costs and order quantity that are less than 0, those data are removed).
### Key Insights 
**a) Regional Sales Analysis**
- 	Market Performance: APAC leads in total sales contribution (approximately 3.59M) followed by EU (2.94M) and US (2.30M). 
- 	Customer Segmentation: Consumer segment dominates sales across all regions, particularly in APAC and EU. 
- 	Regional Profitability: EU’s Central region shows the highest average sales per customer (2,114.35) with 777 customers. 
- 	Geographical Distribution: Sales are heavily concentrated in North America, Europe, and Asia, with minimal presence in Africa and Canada. 
- 	Customer Base: The company has served more than 1500 customers in a period of 4 years, generating more than 22K orders worth 11.73M in total sales. 
- 	Seasonal Trends: Sales and profits show strong seasonality with peaks in a period from September to December. 
- 	City Performance: New York City, Los Angeles, and Seattle are top performing cities, while Lahore, Philadelphia, and Tegucigalpa show losses. 
- 	Product Analysis: Chairs, and Bookcases are the highest-selling furniture categories with strong average prices.
  
**b) Logistics Performance**
-  Shipping Efficiency: Average shipping duration is 3.98 days across 22.53K shipments at an average cost of 27.19. Even though there are clear rankings between various regions about shipping wait, the gap has not shown a huge difference (3-4 days in average), showing that the business has managed efficiently in shipping operation. 
-	Shipping Preferences: Standard Class is overwhelmingly preferred (27.64K shipments) over Second Class (9.24K) and First Class (6.75K).
-	 Shipping Duration Distribution: Most shipments (13K) take around 4-5 days, showing opportunity for efficiency improvements. 
-	Order-Shipping Correlation: Higher order volumes in November-December correspond with shorter average shipping durations, suggesting operational efficiency during peak seasons.
### Recommendations: 

**1. Regional Market Strategy Optimization**
Based on Regional Sales Analysis:
-	Expand European Central Operations: Leverage the exceptionally high average sales per customer ($2,214.35) by increasing marketing investment and store presence in this region to maximize returns on customer acquisition.
-	Implement APAC Growth Strategy: Capitalize on APAC's leading sales contribution ($3.59M) by developing market-specific product offerings that cater to the consumer segment's preferences, which dominates sales in this region.
-	Develop Recovery Plans for Underperforming Markets: Create targeted intervention strategies for cities with negative profitability (Philadelphia, Lahore, Tegucigalpa) including local market research, product assortment adjustments, and operational efficiency improvements.
  
**2. Logistics and Supply Chain Enhancement**
Based on Logistics Operations Analysis:
-	Optimize Shipping Method Selection: Restructure shipping options given that Standard Class represents the overwhelming preference (27.64K shipments), potentially eliminating underutilized premium options or rethinking their value proposition.
-	Implement City-Specific Logistics Solutions: Deploy dedicated last-mile delivery solutions for the top 3 longest wait cities (Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia). 
-	Establish Seasonal Capacity Planning: Develop a predictive capacity model for the September-December peak period when shipment volumes reach their highest points (2.8K-2.9K orders) to maintain or improve current delivery efficiency during high-volume periods.
- Create Expedited Shipping Program for High-Margin Products: Prioritize faster shipping for product categories with highest margins, particularly in the furniture category (chairs and bookcases) to increase customer satisfaction for premium purchases.
  
**3. Product Portfolio Management**
- Expand Furniture Category Leadership: Invest in expanding the chairs ($1.43M in sales) and bookcases ($1.37M) product lines with new designs and features, given their strong sales performance and healthy average prices.
- Rationalize Office Supplies Assortment: Review the office supplies category, particularly focusing on improving margins for art supplies which show high volume (672 products) but low average price ($489.37).
- Implement Product-Specific Shipping Standards: Address shipping duration variances by product type, particularly for envelope products where shipping times range from 3.5 to 5.75 days, by standardizing packaging and shipping processes.
  
**4. Customer Segmentation and Marketing Strategy**
Based on Customer Analysis:
-	Prioritize Consumer Segment Development: Create loyalty programs specifically for the consumer segment, which dominates sales contribution across all regions, particularly in APAC and EU.
-	Implement Regional Customer Acquisition Tactics: Develop market-specific customer acquisition strategies based on current customer density (EU: 777 customers, APAC: 705 customers) to optimize marketing spend efficiency.
-	Launch Cross-Selling Program for High-Value Customers: Identify and target the highest-value customers in each region with personalized cross-selling campaigns focused on complementary products within their preferred categories.
